# Day 1

## Introduction & setup
 
Introduce yourself and meet your fellow boot campers. Set up your new MacBooks, ensuring all necessary software and tools are installed and configured for the day.

## Introduction to pairing (Presentation)

Learn about pair programming and its benefits.

## Create a vulnerable web app  

Develop a web application intentionally designed with security flaws for testing purposes.

Create a new repo to share with your pairing partner, using the source code from the [vulnerable-web-app](/vulnerable-web-app) repository folder. This will act as a base for the web application you will be working on throughout the boot camp.

## Add a vulnerability to your web app

Decide upon a new vulnerability to add to your new web app, using an example you like the look of from our [Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security).

Use TDD to write a failing test for the new vulnerability, then implement the vulnerability in your web app.

## Introduction to Burp Pro (Presentation)  

Learn about Burp Suite Pro, our tool used by pen testers across the globe for scanning and testing for vulnerabilities on the web.

Exploit your newly added vulnerability manually.

## Scan the web app with Pro

Use Burp Suite Pro to identify security issues in the web application. You should find your new vulnerability!
